    She attended a local High School in her town and graduated from there with the intention of pursuing mathematic. Her math theacher is infact the person who inspired her to keep going with math. She then decided to be a math teacher hersel so, she went to New York State College for teachers(now is call State University of New York) for 4 years where she got her BA in mathematic with a minor in phisycs. After all the time spend in school, she realize that she'll need a master degree in oder to obtain full teaching certification. She went to Columbia University before transferring to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where she graduated with a MA in mathematic. She registered in some of the first computing courses ever offered there and learn how to program an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650">IMB 650 </a>(Magnetic Drum Data-Processing Machine) and early digital computer made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM"> IMB </a> (International Business Machines) in the mid 1950s. It was the first mass-produced computer in the world. She learn how to program it from Bernard Galler who was co-developer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAD_%28programming_language%29"> MAD </a> language and later became president of the ACM and ACM fellow. She got offer a job by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM"> IMB </a> because they often hosted meeting at the University of Michigan.

    She had only the intention of paying off her student debts and then returning to teaching. Instead she stay at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM"> IMB </a> for her entire 45 years of Career. When she joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM"> IMB </a> in 1957 at New York Poughkeepsie, as a programmer she taught incomming employees the basics of Fortran(third generation compiled imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing). In 1959 she was assigned to Harvest project for code breaking with National Security Agency and work on a programming language called Alpha. In 1962, she was transfered to the headquarter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Research"> IMB main research </a>. She worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Advanced_Computer_Systems_project"> ACS-1 </a> (Advence Computer Systems) project.

    <h1>Award and Honors</h1>
    <center>

    She was a well known computer scientist since she won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"> A.M Turning Award </a> (it equivalent to the Noble Prize) in 2006 she was the first woman to win the award. She receive the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Parallel_and_Distributed_Processing_Symposium#IEEE_Computer_Society_Charles_Babbage_Award"> IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award </a> in 1997 and also the Computer Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computer Society in 2004. She was inducted into Witi Hall of Fame in 1997. She won the 2002 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace_Award"> Augusta Ada Lovelace Award </a> from the association for woman in computing. 2 years later she was the winner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Borg_Institute_Women_of_Vision_Awards"> ABIE Award for Technical Leadership </a> from the Anita Borg Institute. Her pioneering contributions to the study and application of optimizing language techniques that established the foundation for modern optimizing languages and automatic parallel execution earned her an honorary doctor of science degree from McGill University in 2009.
